              Kiara was our home before it was a restaurant. A house in Antipolo
              where tables got pulled together, stories ran long, and there was
              always too much food. We just opened the door so you can stay a
              while.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything is cooked the way it has always been cooked here.
              Lovingly, a little slow, and with the expectation that you will
              ask for seconds.
